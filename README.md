I use XAMPP

place dqs folder inside xampp's directory mainly
//C:\xampp\htdocs\
and use phpMyAdmin to and create table `dqs` and import the dqs.sql there
and start xampp development e.g. mysql and apache

to access the proj open browser and put this in browser address bar
`localhost:8080/dqs`  
//port 8080 might be different if you configured you xampp.ini
refer to xampp control panel to see the port number, specifically apache ports
